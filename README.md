# **Battleship**

## Battleship is a two-player game, where you try to sink your opponent's ships before losing all of yours.

### **Getting started**
[Click here to play!](https://chrisdotgrubb.github.io/calcifer-project1/)

Each player places their ships on their playing board.
The ships must be completely on the 10x10 grid, without overlapping.
There are five different ships of varying lengths. You can switch between vertical or horizontal placement by pressing \[Spacebar] before placing.
- Carrier: 5 spaces long
- Battleship: 4 spaces long
- Cruiser: 3 spaces long
- Submarine: 3 spaces long
- Destroyer: 2 spaces long

### **Gameplay**
The active player guesses a cell on their opponents board. The opponent checks their board and responds with either "hit" or "miss" depending on whether they have a ship at that location. The player will mark that spot with a red mark for a hit, or a white mark for a miss. This tracking allows the player to visualize where the remaining ships may be located. If the shot sinks a ship, the opponent will call out which ship was sunk by the shot (e.g.,"You sank my battleship"). Players take turns until all of one player's ships have been sunk. The winner is the player with ships still floating.
